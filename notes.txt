Things I want to do:

 + Create multipart MIME messages
 + Browse/Extract multipart MIME messages
 + Transform MIME messages without unneeded modifications to content


Creation
--------

 + via a domain specific language like oleg's html stuff
 + via an algorithm or UI

Extract
-------

 + Convert to HTML or some other unrelated format

Transform
---------

 + Convert email->NNTP, etc


What this means
---------------

Transformation means preservation of the FWS, comments, and other
'optional' data.

Extraction will often want FWS stripped.

Creation can happen directly -- with intermediate AST.

Does an AST help
----------------

 + transformation - definately, because there needs to be a way to
 preserve the original formatting.

 + extract - AST might allow for formatting to be preserved if
 desired. Easy to writing something that 'flattens' the AST?

 + creation - easier to manipulate a partially formed document?
